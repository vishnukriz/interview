**Selenium**
---
Selenium is an open-source automated testing tool to validate the web application in multiple browsers and platforms.We can actually run multiple programming languages on selenium like java, .net, php, c# and various etc,the testing we done on the selenium tool is known as selenium testing.

Advantages:
1. Open source, no license cost required
2. Selenium supports multiple languages like java, python, ruby, .net, php, c#, java script etc
3. Compatiable with various operating system - windows, mac os, linux, unix
4. Browser compactablity - runs the script on varios browsers like edge, chrome, safari, opera, firefox, IE etc
5. framework availability and flexibility, reusability, integrated and parallel test execution.

Disadvantages:
1. Tests only web-applications - Selenium supports the testing of only web-based applications. Mobile applications, Desktop applications cannot be tested using Selenium unless integrated with third-party tools like Appium and TestNG.
2. No built-in reporting - Selenium can generate reports only using third-party tools like TestNG or JUnit.
3. Unavailability of tech support - Since Selenium is an open-source tool, no dedicated support for user issues is available

**Components of Selenium**
---
1. Selenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - It is a Firefox/Chrome plug-in that is developed to speed up the creation of automation scripts by recording the user actions on the web browser and exporting them as a reusable script.
2. Selenium Remote Control (RC) - It is a server that enables users to generate test scripts in their preferred programming language. It accepts commands from the test scripts and sends them to the browser as Selenium core JavaScript commands, for the browser to behave accordingly.
3. Selenium WebDriver: It is a programming interface that helps to create and run test cases directly by communicating with the web browser and using its native compatibility to automate.
4. Selenium Grid: It allows parallel execution of tests on different browsers and operating systems by distributing commands to other machines simultaneously.

**Automation Testing**
---
Test Automation is a process of automating the manual testing process of an application or a system by using testing tools that allow you to create scripts that can be executed repeatedly, generating detailed test reports of the application or system under test.

Advantages:
1. It supports both the performance and functional testing of an application or system.
2. It facilitates the execution of repeated test cases.
3. It allows the parallel execution of the test cases.
4. It improves the accuracy and efficiency of the system by reducing the manual intervention of humans to generate test cases.
5. It saves valuable time and money for the testing team involved in the project.

**XPath in Selenium Explain XPath Absolute and XPath Relative**
---
XPath, also defined as XML-Path (Extensible Markup Language Path), is a language used to query XML documents and provide functionalities like locating elements in Selenium by iterating through each element in a webpage. 
In XPath, data is stored in a key-value pair format similar to an HTML tag. It uses a single slash, i.e. ‘ / ’ for creating an absolute path, and a double slash, i.e. ‘ // ’ for creating a relative path for an element to be located on a webpage

**Questions**

- Selenium 2.0 vs 3.0
- XPath
- Types of Webdrivers API available in Selenium
- exceptional test in Selenium 




  
**TDD (Test Driven Development)**
--- 
   Software Development practices that focus on creating unit test case of application before the actual development of code. An iterative approach combining programming, unit test creation, and refactoring.
   In TDD, developers create small test cases for every feature based on their initial understanding. The primary intention of this technique is to modify or write new code only if the tests fail. This prevents duplication of test scripts.
--- 

**Behavior-driven development (BDD)**
---
  Agile software development methodology in which an application is documented and designed around the behavior a user expects to experience when interacting with it.
---
  
**test types supported by selenium**
---
1. Functionality testing - testing the functionality of the application or we can say testing each and every component of the application against the requirement specification.
2. Intergration testing - Testing the dataflow or the interface between the modules
3. Regression Testing - Testing the unchanged features to make sure that it is not broken due to modify, adding or removing, bug fixing/ Reexecution of same test cases in diff release to make sure that the changes are not introducing any defects in unchanged features.
4. Acceptance testing - End to end testing done by engg at the customer place and take all the ral time business scenarios to check the s/w working as expected.
5. Performance testing - testing the stability and response time of app by applying load 
6. Smoke Testing - testing the basic and critical features before doing thorough testing.
7. Sanity testing - Deep and narrow testing approch
8. Adhoc testing - testing the app randomly with any formal doc
