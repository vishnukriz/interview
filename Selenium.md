**TDD (Test Driven Development)**
--- 
   Software Development practices that focus on creating unit test case of application before the actual development of code. An iterative approach combining programming, unit test creation, and refactoring.
   In TDD, developers create small test cases for every feature based on their initial understanding. The primary intention of this technique is to modify or write new code only if the tests fail. This prevents duplication of test scripts.

**Behavior-driven development (BDD)**
---
  Agile software development methodology in which an application is documented and designed around the behavior a user expects to experience when interacting with it.

**test types supported by selenium**
---
1. Functionality testing - testing the functionality of the application or we can say testing each and every component of the application against the requirement specification.
2. Intergration testing - Testing the dataflow or the interface between the modules
3. Regression Testing - Testing the unchanged features to make sure that it is not broken due to modify, adding or removing, bug fixing/ Reexecution of same test cases in diff release to make sure that the changes are not introducing any defects in unchanged features.
4. Acceptance testing - End to end testing done by engg at the customer place and take all the ral time business scenarios to check the s/w working as expected.
5. Performance testing - testing the stability and response time of app by applying load 
6. Smoke Testing - testing the basic and critical features before doing thorough testing.
7. Sanity testing - Deep and narrow testing approch
8. Adhoc testing - testing the app randomly with any formal doc
