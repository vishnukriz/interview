**Selenium Webdriver installation**
---
Step 1 – Install Java Software Development Kit (JDK)/(SDK)
Note: JDK version comes bundled with Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
Step 2 – Install Eclipse IDE
Step 3 – Selenium WebDriver Installation (Files)

Step 4 – Configure Eclipse IDE with WebDriver
1.Launch the “eclipse.exe” file inside the “eclipse” folder that we extracted in step 2. If you followed step 2 correctly, the executable should be located on C:\eclipse\eclipse.exe.
2.When asked to select for a workspace, just accept the default location.
3. Create a new project through File > New > Java Project. Name the project as “newproject”.
A new pop-up window will open. Enter details as follow:

Select an execution JRE
Select the layout project option
Click on the Finish button
4. In this step,
Right-click on the newly created project and
Select New > Package, and name that package as “newpackage”.
5. Create a new Java class under newpackage by right-clicking on it and then selecting- New > Class, and then name it as “MyClass”.
In this step,
Right-click on “newproject” and select Properties.
On the Properties dialog, click on “Java Build Path”.
Click on the Libraries tab, and then
Click on “Add External JARs..”
6. Add all the JAR files inside and outside the “libs” folder. Your Properties dialog should now look similar to the image below.
